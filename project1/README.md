## Summary:
An implementation of a Card Deck using 2 classes: Card and CardDeck. The Card class represents a Card by holding a string to represent suit and holding an int to represent rank. The CardDeck holds Card objects, keeps order of Card objects, and is able to add, insert at(index), replace, remove, swap cards as well as check to see if it has a card, count how many of a certain card it has, and take away n number of cards and return those cards.

## Files:
- Card.cpp
- Card.hpp
- CardDeck.cpp
- CardDeck.hpp
- test.cpp

## Instructions:
After downloading all files to a directory, compile using: `clang++ test.cpp -o test`.

Then, run using: `./test`

Look in test.cpp to play around with written test functions to test different functionalities of Card and CardDeck classes.
