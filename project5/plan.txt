7/29: 
X setup work environment - code skeleton
X draw out hash table with chaining
X design hash table implementation
X implement simplified hash table w/hashing fcn
X try to implement "entry" modules (Node)
X work on T9
7/30:
X try to implement "overflow entries" (Doubly Linked List)
X Node + Doubly Linked List testing 
7/31 - 8/1: 
- testing on large scale
- workout load factor / resizing
	- multiply char->int value by base value of polynomial (an odd base number is often used).
	- resize always to a prime number table size
- testing with dataset_small 
8/2-8/4: 
- testing with dataset_small and dataset_large
- buffer + writing documentation/specification
- read necessary information for implementing an application (i.e. makefile, database executable, etc.)
