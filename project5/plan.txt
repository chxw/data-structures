7/29: 
X setup work environment - code skeleton
X draw out hash table with chaining
X design hash table implementation
X implement simplified hash table w/hashing fcn
X try to implement "entry" modules (Node)
X work on T9

7/30:
X try to implement "overflow entries" (Doubly Linked List)
X Node + Doubly Linked List testing 

7/31 - 8/2:
- Hash 
	- workout load factor / resizing (resize always to a prime number table size)
	X multiply char->int value by base value of polynomial (an odd base number is often used).
- Entries
	- test adding removing rigorously / on larger scale (use dataset_small)
	- should Entries keep track of # of nodes (i.e. # of collisions) as a means to decide whether or not to resize
- Program
	- reading files in main()
	- start writing documentation/specification
- LAB 10

8/2-8/4: 
- testing with and dataset_large
- buffer + writing documentation/specification
