## Summary:

Implementation of a Linked List data structure using 2 classes: `Node` and `LinkedList`. Linked List has only methods for adding Nodes to the Front of the LL and removing nodes from the front of the LL. Both Linked List and Node classes have a method called `toString()` capable of converting Node/LL into string representations. 

## Files:
- test.cpp 
- Node.hpp 
- Node.cpp 
- LinkedList.hpp 
- LinkedList.cpp 
- README.md

## Instructions:
After downloading these files into a directory, `cd` into that directory, and continue.

In order to compile this program, enter this in bash: `clang++ -std=c++11 test.cpp LinkedList.cpp Node.cpp -o test`

To run program, enter this: `./test`
